### UI Stack & Accessibility

- **Tailwind**: Prefer utility classes over CSS modules. Follow mobile-first responsive design.
- **Shadcn UI**: Use headless components; compose with Tailwind. Prefer named exports.
- **Radix**: Use Radix primitives for accessibility; forward refs; pass through `className` and `...props`.
- **Aria**: Ensure roles, labels, and keyboard navigation are correct.
- **Images**: Use Next Image where applicable; prefer `.webp`/`.avif`, include width/height, use `loading="lazy"` when not LCP.
